*Ted the bear - Find this example under [`examples/ted.obj`](./examples/ted.obj)*

---

## Features
- Reads and renders `.obj` files to the terminal.
- Render with both **braille** (`⡟`) and **block** (`▛`) characters.
- Choose between wireframe and vertices modes.
- Use mouse controls to view your model, just like any other 3d software.

## Installation
Installing Terminal3d can be done via brew, crates.io, nix, or from source.

### From brew
To install Terminal3d with brew, install from [this tap](https://github.com/liam-ilan/homebrew-terminal3d).
```sh
brew install liam-ilan/terminal3d/terminal3d
``` 

You will be able to invoke the binary as `t3d`. Render a `.obj` file with
```sh
t3d <filepath.obj>
```

### From crates.io
Terminal3d is published as a crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/terminal3d). If you have Cargo, you can install it with
```sh
cargo install terminal3d
```

You will be able to invoke the binary as `t3d`. Render a `.obj` file with
```sh
t3d <filepath.obj>
```

### From nix
Terminal3d can be built and executed with [nix](https://nixos.org/). If you have a nix setup, it's straightforward. 

Note: t3d has no release or tag yet, the `default.nix` defaults to HEAD.

You can execute it once you've download or cloned this repository, and built it as below.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/liam-ilan/terminal3d.git
```

```sh
cd terminal3d
nix build -f default.nix
```

You will be able to invoke the binary as `t3d`. Render a `.obj` file with
```sh
result/bin/t3d <filepath.obj>
```

### From Source
If you don't want to install a Rust crate, but do have Rust installed, you can build and run Terminal3d directly from source.

Clone this repository,
```sh
git clone https://github.com/liam-ilan/terminal3d.git
```

To render a `.obj` file, navigate to the root of the repo directory, and run
```sh
cargo run --release <filepath.obj>
```
